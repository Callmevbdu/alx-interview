Given a pile of coins of different values, determine the fewest number of coins
needed to meet a given amount total.

    * Return: fewest number of coins needed to meet total
        - If total is 0 or less, return 0
        - If total cannot be met by any number of coins you have, return -1
    * coins is a list of the values of the coins in your possession
    * The value of a coin will always be an integer greater than 0
